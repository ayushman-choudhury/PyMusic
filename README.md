# PyMusic: Musical Explorations in Python

Hello! I am Ayushman Choudhury, graduating Brown University in the Class of 2025 with concentrations in Applied Mathematics â€” Computer Science and Music. This project is my Senior Thesis in Music. I had 3 goals:
1. Implement Wave Synthesis for myself in Python
2. Use Python's ability to easily work with Big Data to construct interesting Data Sonifications
3. Situate Python-generated sounds within the context of an otherwise-human instrumental ensemble.

In this repository, you can view the code I used, the .wav outputs of that code, and all the sheet music. 

The order of the program is:
1. hello_world.py
2. Independence
3. Saans
4. Sirens
5. Turbulence
