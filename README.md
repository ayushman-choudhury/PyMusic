# PyMusic: Musical Explorations in Python

Hello! I am Ayushman Choudhury, graduating Brown University in the Class of 2025 with concentrations in Applied Mathematics â€” Computer Science and Music. This project is my Senior Thesis in Music. I had 3 goals:
1. Implement Wave Synthesis for myself in Python
2. Use Python's ability to easily work with Big Data to construct interesting Data Sonifications
3. Situate Python-generated sounds within the context of an otherwise-human instrumental ensemble

In this repository, you can view the code I wrote and all the sheet music. You can check out the .wav outputs [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y7xn2D2IrMf8XWSyzj26Gw350WG4PYGT?usp=sharing).

You're welcome to browse as you like, but if you're interested, the order of the program was:
1. hello_world.py
2. Independence
3. Saans
4. Sirens
5. Turbulence


I don't have the recording from the Music Department yet, but [here's a recording from the audience](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xl_xNWWtt9hdazABUpSBkxJXJa-Iwx9U?usp=sharing). Thanks mom!
