This song explores Data Sonification through **rhythm**. Specifically, I use a method of converting text into rhythm that's been around for almost 2 centuries: Morse Code!

As my data source, I use the United States Declaration of Independence. Although the U.S. Constitution is the legal document underpinning the United States, I frequently look to the Declaration as a guiding star for what our Founders intended for this place to be, and what compelled them to begin a revolution in order to create that place. 

This piece is a conversation between the Python-generated audio and 4 instrumental parts. For my concert, these parts were performed by:
- Mason Zhang, flute
- DJ Pennix, trumpet
- Ryan Lee, snare drum
- Jeremy Fleming, piano

I used the phrase "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" as a starting point, giving the flute a motive where the rhythm is "life" encoded, the trumpet a motive where the rhythm is "liberty" encoded, the snare drum an extended solo in the middle with the whole line, and the piano a rhythmically augmented duet between the two motives. I also wrote accompaniments and countermelodies around these.

I was reading the famous "Charges Against The King" section that explains the reasons why the Founders chose to break away from England, and was alarmed at how similar King George III's actions mirrored the actions of the current ruling class. A selection of quotes, encoded to Morse Code, play out of time in the middle section, to create a feeling of chaos. I displayed the text on my slides at my thesis. The quotes are:

> 'The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.'

- 'He has refused his assent to laws'
- 'He has obstructed the Administration of Justice'
- 'He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone'
- 'He has obstructed the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners'
- 'cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world'
- 'transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences'
- 'He has destroyed the lives of our people'
- 'He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us'
